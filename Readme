## Inventory Simulation API using FastAPI & OpenAI GPT
This application simulates and analyzes inventory data using OpenAI's GPT model via a RESTful API built with FastAPI. 
It is ideal for inventory planners, supply chain analysts, and developers looking to 
automate reorder quantity recommendations and trend insights using natural language processing.

## Features
Simulate daily inventory over a given period
Calculate recommended reorder quantity using dynamic parameters
Generate daily-level inventory insights using GPT
Analyze inventory simulation to detect stockouts, reorder opportunities, and optimization trends
API built with FastAPI for easy integration and testing

## Tech Stack
Python 3.9+
FastAPI
OpenAI GPT-3.5
Uvicorn (ASGI server)
Pandas, Matplotlib
