Insights: Key Insights:

1. Number of Stockouts and When They Occurred:
   - Stockouts occurred on days 6, 12, 18, and 30.
   - Stockouts happened after a day with no order placed, indicating that the inventory level dropped below the demand level.

2. The Most Optimal Reorder Day:
   - Based on the data, the most optimal reorder day would be day 24, as it followed a stockout and allowed for replenishing inventory before another stockout occurred.

3. Trends in Inventory Fluctuations:
   - The inventory level decreases by 20 units each day when no order is placed.
   - After a stockout, the inventory level increases significantly due to the order placed, but then decreases gradually until the next stockout.

4. Recommended Adjustments to Inventory Management:
   - Implementing a reorder point system to automatically place orders when the inventory level reaches a certain threshold could help prevent stockouts.
   - Analyzing demand patterns and adjusting the order quantity based on demand fluctuations could optimize inventory management.

5. Evaluation of Recommended Order Quantity:
   - The recommended order quantity of 1 unit seems to be too conservative, as it does not align with the demand patterns observed in the data.
   - Adjusting the order quantity based on demand variability and lead time could help ensure that the inventory level meets customer demand without excessive stockouts.

Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of proactive inventory management strategies, such as setting reorder points and adjusting order quantities based on demand patterns, to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts.
